# Infinitekill
Author: binarydigitz01 (Arnav Vijaywargiya)

The question hinted at the fact to kill around a million people. However once you kill a single person, the phrase "The flag has been revealed" is shown. The million people was just to throw u off (haha silly billy me). However its really not visible anywhere on screen.
Using memscan or cheat engine, just search "expoctf{" (to look for the flag in the memory).

You'll get the flag: expoctf{jxmpgffwyhkrdgdzpbxpuwsagj}mist
